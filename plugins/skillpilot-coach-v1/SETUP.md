# Set up SkillPilot Coach

## Choose an installation route

SkillPilot has two deliberately separate Claude package routes:

- **Current direct-install Web and Android pilot:** install the supplied
  **SkillPilot Coach v1** package for an eligible paid Claude account. It
  contains the coaching Skill and one declaration for the same remote
  SkillPilot connector. The package has been observed in paid Claude Web chat
  and, after account-level direct installation on Claude Pro, in the native
  Claude app on Android. These observations are not proof of availability
  through Anthropic's official plugin distribution.
- **Separate connector-only installation:** use the published **SkillPilot**
  entry in the **Connectors Directory** only when a connector without the
  coaching Skill is deliberately required. The Connectors Directory remains a
  separate connector-only distribution route with its own Team/Enterprise
  submission gate and is not a prerequisite for plugin submission.

SkillPilot Coach v1 does not broaden its support scope to Claude Desktop Chat,
Cowork or public Claude Code. The observed Android use does not establish
installation from inside Android or availability through a future public
listing. Official submission requires exact-candidate Web and Android
real-client acceptance. Fresh public-listing installation and Android use are
verified after publication and do not form a circular pre-submission gate.

A plugin and Directory installation that reference this exact remote MCP URL may coexist; Claude exposes one set of tools for the shared server.
Do not add a second manual custom SkillPilot connector with the same URL when the plugin or Directory connection already supplies it.

All twelve MCP tools and both interactive MCP Apps come from the remote
SkillPilot connector. The Skill provides coaching instructions only. Neither
the Skill nor the plugin shell implements or duplicates the tools or UIs.

## Current direct-install Web and Android pilot

1. On an eligible paid Claude account, open **Plugins**, upload the approved
   **SkillPilot Coach v1** pilot package and enable it. Do not describe this
   account-level direct installation as an official Directory publication or
   as installation from inside Android.
2. In the plugin's **Connectors** tab, connect the included **SkillPilot**
   connector. An existing published Directory connection may remain active
   when it references the same remote MCP URL; do not add another manual custom
   connection for that URL.
3. Complete the normal OAuth flow. The `offline_access` scope keeps this
   technical connection available; it contains no learner identity
   and selects no SkillPilot learning profile.
4. Open <https://skillpilot.com/> in the first-party SkillPilot WebGUI. In the
   shared web start, visibly choose or load the SkillPilot ID, confirm the
   curriculum and Personal Curriculum, then explicitly choose **Mit Claude
   starten**. SkillPilot creates a fresh opaque `spc_...` learning-session value
   that is valid for exactly 24 hours and prepares the Claude start prompt. The
   permanent SkillPilot ID remains inside SkillPilot.
5. SkillPilot opens Claude Web with its generated start prompt already filled
   into the composer. Review it and select **Send**; do not manually transport
   the prompt. Claude may show its warning for externally supplied input. For
   example, the learning request begins with:

   > Lade mit SkillPilot meinen aktuellen Lernkontext. Fasse mein aktives
   > Lernziel zusammen und schlage den nächsten sinnvollen Schritt vor.

After the account-level installation, the Product Owner has successfully used
the plugin with Claude Pro in the native Claude app on Android. Exact-candidate
Android acceptance must still exercise the bundled connector, OAuth, intended
SkillPilot learning flow and both interactive MCP Apps. The current SkillPilot
handoff remains the reviewed `https://claude.ai/new` Web URL; Android support
does not add or claim a native deep-link contract.

Every SkillPilot tool call in that chat uses the generated `learningSessionId`.
The Web handoff places it transiently in the exact `q` parameter of
`https://claude.ai/new`; do not share that address, copy the value into other
chats, publish it, or ask the learner to type it separately. When the 24 hours
have elapsed, return to the first-party start page and create a new session.
Reconnect the plugin-bundled connector only if Claude reports that its
technical OAuth connection is no longer active.

The connector always requires OAuth. It needs no custom request headers and no
manually registered client ID. OAuth authorizes only the technical connector
transport; the separate 24-hour `spc_...` session authorizes learner access.

## Supported plugin surfaces

The v1 publication scope is limited to eligible paid Claude Chat on the Web and
the native Android app after account-level installation. This v1 package does
not claim Claude Desktop Chat or Cowork support and contains no hooks or
subagents. Each additional surface requires separate acceptance evidence and a
later reviewed release before SkillPilot advertises it.

The plugin uses the connector-owned tools and MCP Apps without copying their
schemas, resources or UI bytes into the plugin package. The current SkillPilot
first-party launch handoff opens Claude Web. Availability of the
plugin on a particular eligible paid plan, region or managed workspace is
governed by Anthropic.

The direct-install pilot demonstrates the Web surface and a native Android use
on Claude Pro, but it does not settle whether Anthropic's official plugin
distribution serves either surface. Public-listing reach is verified after
publication against the exact frozen candidate.

The plugin is not available on Claude Free. SkillPilot's Claude integration
targets adults aged 18 or older. This package does not claim iOS plugin support,
installation from inside the Android app or public Claude Code support.

## Independent Connectors Directory route

The Connector Directory submission is maintained separately. If that
connector-only route is published and deliberately selected, connect it through
**Customize > Connectors**. It may coexist with the plugin when both reference
the exact same remote MCP URL, and Claude exposes one set of tools for that
shared server. Do not add a separate manual custom connection for the same URL.
The Directory route supplies the same twelve tools and two MCP Apps UIs, but not
the coaching Skill. Its Team/Enterprise publisher gate applies only to
Directory submission and does not gate public plugin submission.

## If no learning context is available

Create or resume the learning profile at <https://skillpilot.com>. Choose the
personal curriculum and learning scope there, then return to Claude and reconnect
or, preferably, create a fresh start at
<https://skillpilot.com/>. Claude may coach and update the selected
learning path, but the first-party SkillPilot site owns curriculum setup and
later corrections or withdrawals of ordinary completion.

## Maintainer validation and updates

Run the repository-local structural check and tests:

```bash
node ai/claude/plugin/skillpilot-coach-v1/check-package.mjs
node --test ai/claude/plugin/skillpilot-coach-v1/check-package.test.mjs
node --test ai/claude/plugin/skillpilot-coach-v1/build-package.test.mjs
node ai/claude/plugin/skillpilot-coach-v1/build-package.mjs
```

The build produces the deterministic release archive
`skillpilot-coach-v1.plugin`; do not hand-edit that generated archive.

Before publication, also run the official Anthropic check in an environment with
the Claude CLI installed:

```bash
claude plugin validate ai/claude/plugin/skillpilot-coach-v1 --strict
```

The local check does not replace the exact-candidate Claude OAuth and tool-flow
acceptance runs on Web and Android. Neither validation nor a successful direct
upload proves public-listing availability; that is verified after publication.

Compatible package improvements increment the plugin's semantic version while the
Claude v1 connector contract remains compatible. A breaking instruction package
uses a new major plugin version. A breaking MCP, OAuth, identity, or state contract
also requires a separately reviewed connector major and endpoint; it must not
silently replace the v1 endpoint.
