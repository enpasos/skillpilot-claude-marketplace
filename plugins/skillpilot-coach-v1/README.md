# SkillPilot Coach v1

SkillPilot Coach v1 is the public-plugin candidate for curriculum-grounded
SkillPilot learning coaching. Its product scope is limited to eligible paid
Claude Chat on the Web and the native Android app. Version 1.1.7 is the sole
current replacement candidate. Local preparation does not establish deployment,
Marketplace publication or real-client acceptance. The existing 1.1.6 artifact
and its publication evidence remain immutable; older packages are not a
fallback for testing this candidate.

Earlier v1 direct-install packages were demonstrated in paid Claude Web chat.
The Product Owner also used an earlier account-level direct installation with a
Claude Pro account in the native Claude app on Android. Those observations do
not transfer to the 1.1.7 candidate. Exact-candidate direct-install,
public-listing installation and the complete Android learning flow remain
pending until they are verified for 1.1.7. The earlier Android observation also
does not establish that the package can be installed from Android itself or
that a public listing will reach Android. iOS, Claude Desktop Chat, Cowork and
public Claude Code remain outside this candidate's claims.

## Install and start

1. During the approved pilot, install and enable the supplied **SkillPilot
   Coach v1** package for an eligible paid Claude account. After publication,
   use the official listing and verify that fresh listing installation on the
   same account reaches both Web chat and the native Android app.
2. Connect the bundled **SkillPilot** connector through its OAuth flow.
3. Start every learning session at <https://skillpilot.com/>. There you choose
   the SkillPilot ID and Personal Curriculum that should be used, and then
   explicitly select **Mit Claude starten**.
4. SkillPilot opens the current Claude Web handoff with a fresh start message.
   Review and send it. Android plugin usability does not change that existing
   first-party Web handoff.

The first-party start creates an opaque `spc_...` learning-session value that
is valid for exactly 24 hours. The permanent SkillPilot ID remains inside
SkillPilot and is not copied into Claude. See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for the
complete installation and security boundary.

## Package boundary

The plugin contains the SkillPilot coaching Skill and one declaration for the
remote SkillPilot connector. All fourteen MCP tools and both interactive MCP Apps
come from that connector; the plugin does not duplicate their schemas,
resources, or UI bytes.

Version 1.1.7 makes explicit continuation available beyond daily quotas and
plan dates. A plan guides and prioritizes; it must never prevent learning.
The Skill owns the common coaching flow; conditional references supply the
Verified Recall and exam procedures only when needed. Local regression checks do not establish
successful execution in a user's Claude account.

The retained 1.1.4 privacy correction deliberately removes assessment prose from tool
inputs. Claude judges the work and writes feedback and success messages in the
chat. Mastery calls carry only the structured completion decision; Verified
Recall carries only the required card identifiers and pass/fail results, never
answers, reasoning, `workFeedback`, `outcomeFeedback` or Recall `feedback`.
This is an intentional input-contract contraction, not backward compatibility.
Use the corrected backend together with refreshed connector tools and this
plugin version. Old cached inputs are rejected; they must not be reintroduced
to make an old installation work. OAuth, learner-session, tool identity and
backend-owned progression boundaries remain unchanged.

Version 1.1.7 keeps the chat plan-first with a compact plan status formulated by
the backend. Claude quotes `learningPlanToday.text` verbatim and adds no counts
or judgement of its own, for example:
“Mathematik: Tagesziel 2 von 3 · im Plan” and
“Physik: Heute kein Tagesziel · 2 Lernziele im Rückstand”. The active learning
goal is announced separately, once, when teaching begins. The backend merges all plans of a subject, evaluates the
learner's chosen day or week basis, formulates the text in the session language
and names unevaluable plans instead of reporting them as zero. The same text
appears in the SkillPilot cockpit. Automatic continuation stops when the period
targets are reached; further learning follows an explicit learner request and is
celebrated as voluntary extra work. If backlog remains, the coach offers a
pressure-free chance to catch up with one next open goal, while pausing stays
possible. Without backlog, it offers voluntary continuation or a pause.
Zero daily quota, an empty backlog, future plan dates or an exhausted plan never
block explicitly requested learning. The backend continues an active unmastered
goal or selects a reachable open target from the Personal Curriculum, preserving
prerequisites and the learner's current authorized choices. Only completion of
the whole Personal Curriculum ends its learning content; temporary blockers
must not be presented as completion.
Continue or resume the backend-selected goal without requiring a Web-app
button. Existing plan dates, fourteen tools and learner-session boundaries
remain in place.
An explicit request such as “switch to Physics” changes the current planned
subject through the connector while every valid subject plan continues to
contribute to the day's requirements. The backend parks an unfinished goal and
selects a reachable open goal for the requested subject without exposing plan or goal
identifiers.

Within a valid learning session, the learner can simply return to the chat and
say “weiter” or “now Physics”. Claude starts the next concrete explanation or
task and repeats the plan status only after a status-relevant change. A status question reports the
plan without changing the current subject. After an ordinary goal or Verified
Recall finishes, Claude uses the refreshed progress and backend-selected
successor. When the period targets are reached, it celebrates them;
this does not mean that the entire plan or all remaining backlog is complete.
Blocked or unavailable work is not presented as completed.

SkillPilot Coach v1 does not claim support for Claude Free, iOS, installation
from inside the Android app, Claude Desktop Chat, Cowork, hooks, subagents, or
public Claude Code. Those surfaces require their own acceptance evidence and a
later reviewed release before SkillPilot can advertise them.

The historical direct-install observations are not evidence for 1.1.7 or public
Directory availability. Submission readiness requires this exact candidate to
complete the dedicated Web and Android real-client acceptance gates.
Public-listing reach on Android remains a publication verification, not a
circular pre-submission requirement.
