# Changelog

## 1.1.1 - 2026-09-04

- Guide the learner directly from the daily overview to the current planned
  goal, and expose current and continuable subjects for natural chat requests
  such as “now Physics” or “back to Math”.
- Refresh the authoritative per-subject progress after completion and continue
  from the returned successor, including after Verified Recall.
- Distinguish a finished day, a paused plan and unavailable plan work without
  presenting generic goal-selection menus or inventing further daily tasks.
- Keep all fourteen tools and preserve the existing session and installation
  boundaries. All exact-candidate external acceptance remains pending.
- Replace 1.1.0 as the sole current candidate while retaining its immutable
  artifact and release dossier as historical evidence.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-09-04

- Make every learning-session start plan-first: report the due, currently
  mastered and still-open goals for every valid subject plan, with overdue work
  and totals kept explicit.
- Resume the backend-selected planned goal automatically when no active goal is
  present and the authoritative context says resume is available; do not send
  the learner to a Web-app button.
- Warn safely when one or more plans cannot be evaluated, without exposing plan
  identifiers or treating partial totals as complete.
- Add `resume_skillpilot_learning_plan` as the thirteenth connector-owned tool.
- Add `switch_skillpilot_learning_plan_subject` as the fourteenth
  connector-owned tool so a learner can switch explicitly between current valid
  subject plans without leaving the chat or changing which plans apply.
- Reset all candidate-, repository- and real-client-bound acceptance evidence to
  `pending`. Version 1.1.0 completely replaces 1.0.4; earlier artifacts and
  evidence remain immutable historical records, not supported fallbacks.

## 1.0.4 - 2026-09-03

- Keep policy, instruction, tool-schema, parameter, retry and private
  deliberation mechanics out of learner-facing text and speech; present only
  the useful coaching result.
- Treat a clear start or continuation intent after the tailored orientation
  exchange as completion without another confirmation loop, persist it before
  continuing, and use only the backend-selected successor.
- Keep ordinary mastery feedback distinct from the silent orientation
  transition and prohibit unsupported promises to remember a learner's topic
  preference as durable state.
- Require exact-candidate acceptance for these behaviors in Claude Web and
  native Android Voice mode before Marketplace activation and the first-party
  route switch.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-09-03

- Prepare the first public personal Git marketplace candidate. Publication
  remains blocked until the candidate-specific acceptance and activation
  evidence passes.
- Make the pre-public controlled-user cutover from uploaded 1.0.2 installs
  explicit; 1.0.2 remains immutable historical evidence and is not a supported
  mixed-version fallback.
- Let Claude decide only that the active goal is complete. The SkillPilot
  backend persists that completion, selects the successor and returns its
  canonical context; the plugin no longer sends a model-selected progression
  path.
- Require exact-candidate acceptance that proves completion persistence and
  backend-selected successor behavior in Claude Web and Android Voice mode.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-08-31 (not published)

- Prepared the initial personal Git marketplace tree without publishing it.
- Kept the six plugin files byte-identical to the reviewed 1.0.2 direct-install
  package.
